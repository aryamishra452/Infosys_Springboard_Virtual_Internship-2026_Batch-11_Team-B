ElectViz: Election Data Visualization for Media 🗳️📊

**Project Overview** 📌

ElectViz is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze and present Indian national-level election data in a clear, structured, and insightful manner. The project focuses on transforming complex, candidate-level election datasets into intuitive dashboards that enable users to explore voting trends, party performance, electoral competitiveness, and representation patterns.

Developed using Power BI, ElectViz aims to support data-driven political reporting and analysis by simplifying large-scale election data into meaningful visual narratives. The dashboards are designed to serve media professionals, analysts, and learners by providing fact-based insights into election outcomes across multiple dimensions such as year, state, constituency, party, gender, and candidates.
